# Model PLS-SEM Configuration 
# This file is used to define your model structure.

# 1. Measurement Model
# 'prefixes': If your indicators follow a naming pattern (e.g., F01_1, F01_2 for F01),
#             just write the latent variable name here.
# 'explicit': If your indicators have unique or non-sequential names,
#             write them explicitly here.
measurement_model:
  prefixes:
    - F01
    - F02
    - F03
    - F04
    - F05
    - F06
    - F07
    - F09
    - F10
  explicit:
    F08: [F08_1, F08_2, F08_3, F08_4]

# 2. Structural Model
# Define the hypotheses or path relationships between latent variables.
# Format: [predictor_variable, outcome_variable]

  - [F01, F09]
  - [F02, F09]
  - [F03, F09]

  - [F08, F09]

  - [F04, F10]
  - [F08, F10]
  - [F09, F10]

# 3. Hypothesis Labels
# (Optional) Name each path to make the results table look cleaner.
